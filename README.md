# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Overview

The **Tech Quiz** is an interactive quiz application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This application allows users to take a quiz consisting of ten random questions, answer them, and view their final score. The app includes both a React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express backend that fetches random quiz questions from an API and records the user's score.

This project emphasizes the importance of **robust testing** and ensures that the application is **reliable and efficient**. As part of this project, Cypress has been integrated to provide comprehensive tests for both **component testing** and **end-to-end testing**, allowing the quiz application to meet user demands and perform reliably under various conditions.

## Features

- **Randomized Quiz Questions**: Users are presented with ten random questions, ensuring that every quiz experience is unique.
- **Score Calculation**: After completing the quiz, users are shown their final score based on the number of correct answers.
- **Cypress Integration**: Both **component tests** and **end-to-end tests** are implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application.


### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (local or a cloud instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tech-quiz.git
   cd tech-quiz
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   In the `server` directory, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   In the `client` directory, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Cypress for testing**:
   Install Cypress as a dev dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Configure the backend**:
   Ensure that MongoDB is running and connected properly. If youâ€™re using a local instance, start MongoDB by running:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

   You can configure the database connection in the backend code (under `server/config` or similar).

2. **Configure the frontend**:
   Set up your React app to connect with the backend. The frontend will use API requests to fetch quiz questions and post the final score.

3. **Configure Cypress for testing**:
   Cypress comes with pre-configured testing setup. For both component and end-to-end testing, the basic configuration is ready to use out-of-the-box.

   In the `cypress.json` file, ensure that the URL for your app is set correctly:
   ```json
   {
     "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
   }
   ```

   To ensure smooth component testing, ensure the necessary setup for React components in `cypress/support/component.js`.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:
   In the `server` directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend client**:
   In the `client` directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the app**:
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the Tech Quiz application.

### Running Tests with Cypress

Cypress provides an easy way to run both **component tests** and **end-to-end tests**.

1. **Open Cypress Test Runner**:
   To launch the Cypress Test Runner, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

   This will open the Cypress GUI, where you can select the tests you want to run.

2. **Run End-to-End Tests**:
   End-to-end tests are located in the `cypress/integration` directory. These tests simulate real user interactions with the application and ensure that the entire flow works as expected.

   To run the end-to-end tests, simply select the relevant test file in the Cypress Test Runner.

3. **Run Component Tests**:
   Component tests are located in the `cypress/component` directory. These tests focus on individual components and ensure that they render and behave correctly.

   You can run component tests through the Cypress GUI or by using the following command:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run --component
   ```

### Example Tests

#### Component Test

- **Test**: Ensure the Quiz component displays a question and possible answers correctly.
  ```js
  describe('Quiz Component', () => {
    it('should display the first question correctly', () => {
      cy.fixture('questions.json').then((questions) => {
        cy.mount(<Quiz questions={questions} />);
        cy.get('.card h2').should('contain', questions[0].question);
      });
    });
  });
  ```

#### End-to-End Test

- **Test**: Ensure the entire quiz flow works correctly from starting the quiz to displaying the final score.
  ```js
  describe('Quiz Flow', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      cy.visit('/');
    });

    it('should start the quiz and show the first question', () => {
      cy.contains('Start Quiz').click();
      cy.fixture('questions.json').then((questions) => {
        cy.get('.card h2').should('contain', questions[0].question);
      });
    });

    it('should complete the quiz and show the score', () => {
      cy.contains('Start Quiz').click();
      cy.fixture('questions.json').then((questions) => {
        questions.forEach((question) => {
          cy.contains('.alert-secondary', question.correctAnswer).parent().find('button').click();
        });
      });
      cy.contains('Quiz Completed').should('be.visible');
      cy.get('.alert-success').should('contain', 'Your score: 10');
    });
  });
  ```

## Conclusion

This **Tech Quiz Test Suite** showcases the power of testing with **Cypress**, ensuring that both individual components and the overall application flow are thoroughly tested. By incorporating both **component testing** and **end-to-end testing**, we can confidently deploy the quiz app knowing it performs reliably under various conditions.
